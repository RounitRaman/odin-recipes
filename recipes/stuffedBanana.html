    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 banana peppers

        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes/li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 pound mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut off the tops of peppers. Remove ribs and seeds; rinse peppers. Chop edible portion of the tops; set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add peppers, reduce heat, and simmer until tender but still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Sauté reserved chopped pepper, onion, and celery in hot butter until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and garlic. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, basil, oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine Parmesan cheese, egg, Worcestershire sauce, 1 remaining teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a large bowl. Mix in hot sausage, mild sausage, bread crumbs, and 1 cup tomato sauce mixture until well combined.</li>
        <li>Fill each pepper with sausage mixture using a piping bag or sausage stuffer. Place in a 3-quart casserole dish; pour remaining tomato sauce mixture over peppers.</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and sausage is cooked through, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the filling should read at least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
